<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially wanted to continue backend development for Pairly (Phases 9-15) in mock mode. However, the user pivoted to a complete frontend overhaul with a new design, pages, and features inspired by Bumble and Snapchat, including a creator/fan model, geolocation features, and a new UI theme. The most recent request is to add a 5-page animated intro sequence and a new animated background to the sign-in page using user-provided images, while keeping all other existing content and layouts unchanged.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Backend (Phases 11-15):** Implement Presence, Analytics, Notifications, QA/Hardening, and Deployment prep. (This was done in a rapid, drop-in manner with testing skipped per user instruction).
-   **Frontend Overhaul:**
    -   New landing page content and navigation bar (Features, Support, Safety, Pricing, Creators).
    -   Separate pages for each navigation item.
    -   Signup flow with Creator and Fan roles.
    -   Post-login experience with a social media feed, a Snap Map for nearby users, and a creator-specific upload button.
    -   Updated professional color palette (violet/fuchsia).
    -   A footer component for all pages.
-   **Latest Request (Animation):**
    -   Create a 5-page animated intro sequence before the sign-in screen using 5 provided images.
    -   Each intro page should feature one full-screen image with fade-in and slide-up effects.
    -   Users should be able to scroll/swipe through the intro pages.
    -   The sign-in page background should be an animated slideshow of the same 5 images with a parallax effect.
    -   The existing sign-in form and all other project layouts must remain unchanged.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The backend has mock implementations for Phases 11-15 (Presence, Analytics, Notifications, QA, Deployment), but they are untested. The frontend has been significantly overhauled with new pages, components, and a new color scheme. Pages like Landing, Features, Safety, Support, Pricing, Creators, and the new Signup/Login flow have been created. Post-login pages like Home, SnapMap, Discovery, Profile, and Settings have been scaffolded or restyled. The project is fragile as the user explicitly requested to skip all testing and full frontend-backend integration is pending.

**Last working item**:
The user provided 5 images and detailed instructions to create a new animated intro sequence and update the sign-in page background. The agent acknowledged the request and was about to begin implementation.

-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing a 5-page animated intro and a new sign-in page background animation.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** frontend testing agent should be used after implementation to verify the new animations and ensure no regressions were introduced. A screenshot tool can be used for visual confirmation.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Frontend is unstable and shows a blank page (P0)**
    -   A temporary fix was applied by removing a duplicate import in , which made the UI render again. However, the root cause of the initial blank screen might persist, as this often points to deeper React compilation or runtime errors. The frontend restarted and showed the page, but this could recur.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** Removed duplicate  import from .
    -   **Next debug checklist:** If the blank screen reappears, check the browser console for JavaScript errors. Inspect the  router file and  for any misconfigurations.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** A stable, rendering frontend is required to proceed with any new feature development or testing.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Implement Animated Intro and Sign-In Background (P0)**
    -   **Description:** Create a 5-page animated intro sequence and a new animated background for the sign-in page using the 5 images provided by the user.
    -   **Where to resume:** Start by creating the new intro page components and modifying the  page. The images and animation specifications are in the user's last message.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** Fulfills the user's latest and most direct request.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Connect Frontend to Backend:** The user requested this but it has not been done. This involves wiring up all forms (Login, Signup, Profile, Settings) and data displays (Home feed, Discovery, user profiles) to their corresponding backend API endpoints.
    -   **P1: Implement Full Creator/Fan Functionality:** The UI for role selection exists, but the backend logic for post uploads (Creators), subscriptions, and differentiated user experiences is not implemented. The  needs to be built out with actual upload functionality.
    -   **P1: Implement Geolocation Snap Map:** The  page is a placeholder. A backend service needs to be built to store and retrieve user locations to display on the map.
    -   **P2: Update Profile & Settings Pages:** The  and  pages were styled, but they lack the functionality to fetch and update user data. This needs to be connected to the backend.

-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **P2: Comprehensive Backend & Frontend Testing:** The user repeatedly instructed the agent to skip testing. This has created significant technical debt. The entire backend (Phases 10-15) and the new frontend need to be tested thoroughly using the testing agent to ensure stability and correctness.
    -   **P2: Revisit Original Backend Plan:** The initial plan included thorough implementation and testing of backend phases. The current drop-in code should be reviewed, hardened, and properly tested as originally intended.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1: Lack of Testing**
    -   **Debug checklist:** The user explicitly and repeatedly told the agent to skip testing for all backend and frontend work. This is not a bug but a high-risk directive that has resulted in a large amount of untested code.
    -   **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?** Testing is critical to ensure the application is stable, functional, and free of regressions. Fixing this involves convincing the user to allow testing and then systematically writing and running tests for all new features.
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix:** Both.
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **PRIORITIZE THE ANIMATION TASK:** The user's latest request is to build the animated intro and sign-in screen. This should be your first action.
-   **USER SKIPS TESTING:** The user has repeatedly instructed to skip testing. This is a major risk. After completing the animation task, you should gently but clearly explain the importance of testing the new frontend and backend features to ensure the app is stable, and ask for permission to proceed with it.
-   **FRONTEND/BACKEND IS DISCONNECTED:** The beautiful new frontend is mostly a facade. A major upcoming task is to connect all the UI components and user actions to the backend APIs.
-   **EXISTING LAYOUTS MUST BE PRESERVED:** For the animation task, the user was very specific that no other part of the application's layout or content should be changed. Adhere strictly to this constraint.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.   - **In Progress.** Agent implemented UI changes but connection is pending.
2.   - **In Progress.** Agent identified the pages exist but need functionality.
3.   - **Pending.** This is the current, highest-priority task.
-   **Pending User Messages:** None. The agent is expected to act on the last request.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The frontend-backend connection is non-existent for most new features. The application is untested and likely contains numerous bugs.
-   **Mocked:** All backend services (Payments, Redis, Celery) and the new modules (Presence, Analytics, etc.) are running in mock mode.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Stripe (Payments):** Mocked.
-   **Razorpay (Payments):** Mocked.
-   **Redis:** Mocked (in-memory fallback).
-   **Celery:** Mocked (manual triggers only).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (explicitly skipped by user).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:**
    -   
    -   
    -   
    -   
-   **Known regressions:** Unknown, due to lack of testing.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A (Application is in mock mode and auth flow is not fully connected/tested).

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent did not forget but was explicitly instructed by the user **not to perform any testing** on the vast amount of new code written for both the backend (Phases 11-15) and the entire frontend overhaul. The task to connect the frontend and backend was also acknowledged but not completed before the user issued a new, superseding request for animations.</analysis>
