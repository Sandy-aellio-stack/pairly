<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's goal is to create a dating application named TrueBond. The project began with a backend build, followed by a discarded dark-themed frontend. The current and active task is to build a new, light-themed frontend.

The user has provided multiple, highly-detailed prompts to iteratively design and build a single-page, scroll-based landing page with a premium, modern feel. The user also specified requirements for the after-login experience, which has been deferred.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **App Name:** TrueBond
-   **Theme:** Light, modern, premium, and friendly (Instagram-inspired for the app interior, custom design for the landing page).
-   **Palette:** Primary Background: Soft whites, Accent: Soft purples/lavender/pinks.
-   **Framework:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS.
-   **Animation:** GSAP for all major transitions, reveals, and scroll-based interactions.
-   **Landing Page:** A single-page, scroll-based experience with multiple content-rich sections, a fixed left vertical navigation, and fixed top-right auth buttons. Each section must have a themed background image.
-   **Post-Login Navigation:** An Instagram-style top navigation bar (logo, search, messages, notifications, profile).
-   **Auth Flow:** Currently implemented as a multi-step modal. A previous request for separate, full-screen login/signup pages with animated backgrounds has been superseded but may be revisited.
-   **Map:** A high-quality map using MapLibre GL is planned for the Nearby feature.
-   **Custom Cursor:** A magnifying glass-style cursor with GSAP easing.
-   **Integration:** The frontend must integrate with the existing, tested TrueBond backend.
-   **Constraint:** The user has explicitly and repeatedly requested **NO TESTING** for the frontend. Visual verification only.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
1.  **Backend**: A complete, tested, and production-ready FastAPI backend for the TrueBond app is in place. It includes APIs for auth, profiles, a credit-based messaging system, live location/nearby users, and payments.
2.  **Frontend**: A Vite-based React project is set up. A comprehensive, single-page  has been built and iteratively refined. It includes a hero section, features, safety, support, pricing, and a connect section. It features a fixed glassmorphism-style left navigation, fixed top-right auth buttons, and is heavily animated with GSAP . An  for signup/login also exists.

**Last working item**:
The agent was refining the hero section of the landing page to fix alignment and spacing issues, creating a more visually balanced two-column layout.

-   **Last item agent was working:** Adjusting the hero section layout in  by modifying Tailwind CSS classes to improve container width, padding, and vertical/horizontal alignment of the text content and phone mockup.
-   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (Visual verification via screenshot tool)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** The user has strictly forbidden automated testing. Use the  for visual verification of any UI changes.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: GSAP Animation Trigger (P1)**
    -   **Description:** There was a recurring issue where content animated by GSAP  (e.g., the feature cards) would not appear because its initial state was  and the animation was not always triggering correctly.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent fixed this by removing an initial  class from the CSS and ensuring the GSAP  hook correctly targets the elements to animate them into view.
    -   **Next debug checklist:** If the issue reappears, check the  or  calls in the  hook inside . Ensure the  elements and the animation targets are correct and that there are no conflicting CSS styles.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** The page's content is not visible without these animations working correctly. Fixing it ensures a complete and functional user experience.
    -   **Status:** RESOLVED (but should be monitored for recurrence)
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (Screenshot)

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete the TrueBond Landing Page (P0)**
    -   **Description:** Finalize the single-page landing page based on the user's detailed requirements. The last step was balancing the hero section. This task is pending user review of the latest changes.
    -   **Where to resume:** Await user feedback on the last screenshot showing the balanced hero section. Be prepared to make further fine-tuning adjustments to layout, spacing, or animations in .
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A complete, premium, and visually polished landing page that meets the user's explicit design specifications.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (Screenshot)
    -   **Blocked on something:** User feedback.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:** (After Landing Page is approved)
    -   **P0: Implement Post-Login UI:**
        -   Create the Instagram-inspired top navigation bar.
        -   Remove the left-side landing page navigation after login.
        -   Build the main dashboard feed page.
    -   **P1: Implement High-Quality Map Page:** Create the Nearby page using MapLibre GL, integrating live geolocation data from the backend.
    -   **P1: Implement Redesigned Chat UI.**
    -   **P2: Full Backend Integration:** Connect the auth flow (signup/login), profile creation, and all other features to the backend APIs.

-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **Clarify Auth UI:** The user previously requested separate, full-screen Login and Signup pages with animated backgrounds. The current implementation uses a modal. The next agent should clarify with the user if the modal is sufficient or if the separate pages are still desired.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Frontend Refactoring:** Cleaned up initial component structure and fixed API service to use .
-   **API Route Correction:** Fixed endpoint mismatches in  to align with the backend routes (e.g.,  to ).
-   **Vite Configuration:** Resolved a  issue in  to enable the preview URL.
-   **Iterative Landing Page Build:** Built and repeatedly refined  based on multiple detailed user prompts. This included:
    -   Implementing a full-screen, single-page scroll layout.
    -   Creating a fixed left-side glassmorphism navigation and fixed top-right auth buttons.
    -   Building out multiple content-rich sections (Hero, Features, Safety, Support, Pricing, Connect) with themed background images and GSAP animations.
    -   Incorporating user-provided text content and images.
    -   Debugging and fixing GSAP  animation issues.
    -   Finalizing the hero section layout for better visual balance and alignment.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. All raised issues were either addressed or superseded by new user requirements.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (Beanie ODM), JWT authentication, Geospatial queries.
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Animation:** Heavy use of **GSAP**, specifically , for creating a premium, scroll-based storytelling experience on the landing page.
-   **State Management:** Zustand.

**key DB schema**
-   No changes made. Schema includes , , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
-   None in this session.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx**: The primary file for the entire landing page experience. Contains all sections and GSAP animation logic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/AuthModal.jsx**: The modal for user authentication.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.jsx**: The main React app component containing the router logic.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.css**: Global styles and Tailwind CSS definitions, including the light theme color palette.
-   **/app/frontend/vite.config.js**: Vite build configuration, updated to allow preview host.
-   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.js**: Centralized API service file, updated to match backend routes.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.jsx** is currently a single, very large component (over 1000 lines). For better maintainability, it should be broken down into smaller components, with each section (, , , etc.) becoming its own component file.

**key api endpoints**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Follow User's Lead:** The user acts as the designer and provides very specific, iterative instructions. Adhere to them precisely. Do not introduce your own design ideas.
-   **NO TESTING:** The user has been adamant about **not** performing any automated testing. Use the  for visual confirmation only. Do not create or run test files.
-   **Landing Page is Priority:** The current focus is entirely on perfecting the single-page landing experience. Do not work on post-login features until the user explicitly approves the landing page and asks to move on.
-   **GSAP Proficiency Required:** The entire landing page relies heavily on GSAP, particularly , for its animations and parallax effects. A good understanding of this library is essential for making further edits.
-   **Backend is Stable:** The backend is complete and tested. Do not modify it. Focus on connecting the frontend to the existing endpoints.

**documents created in this job**
-   None.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The post-login functionality (dashboard, map, chat) is not yet built. The user authentication flow is implemented in a modal but is not yet fully connected to the backend API and tested end-to-end.
-   **Mocked:** Razorpay integration in the backend uses sandbox keys.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Razorpay:** Integrated into the backend (sandbox).
-   **Fonoster:** Integrated into the backend for OTP.
-   **MapLibre GL:** To be used for the frontend map feature (not yet implemented).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO (forbidden by user).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO.
-   **Test files created:** None for the frontend.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Razorpay:** Sandbox keys are in .
-   **Fonoster:** API key  is in .

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The user's earlier request to build separate, full-screen login/signup pages with animated backgrounds was not implemented. This was due to the user's subsequent, more detailed prompts focusing on the landing page and its integrated auth modal. This needs to be clarified with the user as a future step.</analysis>
