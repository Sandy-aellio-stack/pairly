<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user's initial request was for backend development on a project called Pairly. This quickly pivoted to a complete frontend overhaul for Pairly with a dark, Bumble-inspired theme. The user then requested to build an entirely new dating application called TrueBond.

This involved:
1.  **Backend Rebuild:** Create a new, production-ready backend for TrueBond using FastAPI, MongoDB, and Redis. This included a credit-based messaging system, live location features, and a robust user authentication system where the user's physical address is collected but never exposed.
2.  **Frontend Rebuild (Dark Theme):** Build a new, immersive frontend for TrueBond with a dark theme, GSAP animations, and a custom cursor.
3.  **Frontend Rebuild (Light Theme):** Immediately after the dark theme frontend was built, the user requested another *complete* rebuild, this time with a light, Instagram-style UI, a left sidebar, a high-quality map (MapLibre GL), and an improved, friendlier signup flow.

The current and active task is to build this new, light-themed frontend for the TrueBond application.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **App Name:** TrueBond
-   **Theme:** Light, modern, and friendly (Instagram-inspired). No dark backgrounds.
-   **Palette:** Primary Background: /, Accent: , Highlight: , Text: .
-   **Framework:** React + Vite.
-   **Animation:** GSAP for all major transitions, reveals, and interactions.
-   **Navigation:** A fixed left vertical sidebar on desktop and a bottom navigation bar on mobile.
-   **Dashboard:** An Instagram-style feed with stories-like bubbles and a vertical feed of user cards.
-   **Map:** A high-quality map using MapLibre GL JS, featuring custom markers, clustering, and smooth interactions.
-   **Auth Flow:** A redesigned, multi-step signup process including a new profile photo upload step.
-   **Chat:** A redesigned chat UI with optional social media links (Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) in the header.
-   **Landing Page:** A single-page, scroll-based experience with GSAP animations.
-   **Custom Cursor:** A magnifying glass-style cursor with GSAP easing.
-   **Integration:** The new frontend must integrate with the existing, tested TrueBond backend.
-   **Constraint:** The user has explicitly requested **NO TESTING** for the frontend.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
1.  **Backend**: A complete, tested, and production-ready backend for the TrueBond dating app exists. It includes APIs for auth, profiles, a credit-based messaging system, live location/nearby users (with geo-indexing), and payment stubs for Razorpay.
2.  **Frontend Build System**: The frontend has been successfully migrated from Create React App (CRACO) to Vite.
3.  **Frontend (Light Theme - In Progress)**: The foundation for the new light-themed frontend has been laid. New dependencies (GSAP, MapLibre) have been installed, a new  with the light color palette is in place, and placeholder components for the new design (, , , ) have been created.

**Last working item**:
The agent was actively building the new, light-themed, Instagram-style frontend for TrueBond as per the user's latest request. It had just set up the initial file structure and was about to implement the Instagram-style home page.

-   **Last item agent was working:** Creating the new light-themed TrueBond frontend, specifically beginning the implementation of the main components after installing dependencies and setting up the basic CSS and file structure.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** The user explicitly requested **NO TESTING**. However, for visual verification, the  should be used after each major component is built.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   There are no known technical bugs or issues. The primary challenge is managing the rapid, iterative nature of the user's requests which has led to previously completed work being discarded.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete the TrueBond Light-Themed Frontend Rebuild (P0)**
    -   **Description:** Build the entire frontend from scratch according to the new Instagram-style design specifications. The previous dark-themed frontend is now obsolete.
    -   **Where to resume:** Continue by creating the Instagram-style home page (), as the layout () and other foundational components have been created.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A modern, light-themed, and fully functional frontend for the TrueBond application that aligns with the user's latest vision.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (visual verification via screenshots only, as per user instructions).
    -   **Blocked on something:** None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **P0: Implement Instagram-Style Dashboard:** Build the main dashboard feed with stories-style bubbles and a vertical scroll of user cards.
    -   **P0: Implement High-Quality Map:** Create the Nearby page using MapLibre GL, integrating live geolocation, custom markers, and clustering.
    -   **P0: Implement Redesigned Chat UI:** Build the new chat interface, including social media link integration.
    -   **P0: Finalize Landing Page:** Complete all GSAP-animated sections for the single-page scroll landing experience.
    -   **P0: Integrate All Pages with Backend:** Connect all frontend components (Auth, Profile, Nearby, Chat, Credits) to the existing, tested TrueBond backend APIs.

-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   There are no other future tasks defined. The user's focus is entirely on the current frontend rebuild.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **TrueBond Backend Implementation:**
    -   Built a complete, production-ready backend for the TrueBond dating app from scratch.
    -   Implemented models, services, and routes for Users, Auth, Credits, Messaging, Live Location, and Payments.
    -   The entire backend successfully passed 20 automated tests.
-   **Frontend Migration (CRACO to Vite):**
    -   Successfully migrated the frontend project from Create React App to Vite, including dependency updates, configuration changes, and script modifications.
-   **TrueBond Frontend v1 (Dark Theme - DISCARDED):**
    -   A full frontend was built based on a dark, immersive, cinematic theme with GSAP animations. This work was subsequently discarded at the user's request.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB with Beanie (ODM), Redis for rate limiting, JWT authentication, Geospatial queries ( index).
-   **Frontend:** React, Vite, GSAP (for all animations), Zustand (for global state), MapLibre GL (for maps), TailwindCSS.
-   **Architecture:** Decoupled frontend/backend. The frontend is being built as a single-page application with client-side routing for the post-login dashboard experience.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.   - **Completed**. Agent built the new backend with Razorpay sandbox keys.
2.   - **Completed & Discarded**. Agent built the dark theme frontend, which was then immediately replaced by a new request.
3.   - **In Progress**. This is the current, active task. The agent has started implementation.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The frontend is in the middle of a complete rebuild, so it's non-functional. The connection between the frontend and the new backend is not yet established.
-   **Mocked:** Razorpay is using sandbox keys. Fonoster API key was provided but implementation is part of the new backend.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Razorpay:** Integrated into the backend with sandbox keys.
-   **Stripe:** Available as an optional provider in the backend but not fully implemented.
-   **Fonoster:** API key provided for OTP, integrated into the backend.
-   **MapLibre GL:** To be used for the new frontend map.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES, for the backend rebuild (all 20 tests passed). NO for the frontend, as per user's explicit instruction.
-   **Test files created:** A full test suite for the TrueBond backend was created by the testing agent. No frontend test files exist.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Razorpay:** Sandbox keys are present in .
-   **Fonoster:** API key  is in .

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent has been following user instructions closely. The major miss is the lack of frontend testing, but this is a direct and repeated instruction from the user, not an oversight.</analysis>
